             <h3>Explain the concept of Responsive Design. What does the term mean? </h3>
             <p>Web development using responsive design generates dynamic differences in a website's appearance depending on the device used and its screen size.
                  The design uses breakpoints to determine how a site should be laid out; one design has an above-the-fold layout.
                   A two-column layout of a desktop might be reduced to two columns when viewed on a tablet and one column on a smartphone.
                    The browser's width is widely used to determine breakpoints; page elements can reshuffle according to the viewport's size.
                     In a responsive design, proportion-based grids rearrange content and design elements.</p>

         <div class="question">
             <h3>How does responsive design relate to web technologies? </h3>
             <p>Web developers build websites that operate on all devices,
                  Responsive web design enables websites to render or present properly on a number of screen sizes, resolutions, orientations, and color capabilities.
                   A good, responsive website meets these requirements. A responsive website automatically adapts to the user's device's screen size and resolution. 
                   It is very beneficial to website users, owners, and designers due to its convenience. 
                   It makes it much simpler to create and maintain a website. Working from one site instead of several makes it easier to manage.</p>

             <h3>What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through your
                research? </h3>
             <p>In the course WEB222, I learned many things about creating your website for different devices and platforms.
                  In the online classes, we practiced javascript language for 3-4 weeks.
                   I understood how to implement and build functions and run the code without problems.
                    Javascript is much more convenient than C++ language.
                     Also, we practised HTML language for writing websites, and it was very cool.
                     In this language, it wasn't any issues because it was understandable what to write and how to implement it. 
                     The last thing I learned is CSS, and this one is fascinating among the previous two and the easiest one. 
                     You can create any style for a website, format with any proportions, colours and size.</p>

             <h3>Finally, describe your learning experience in the course. </h3>
             <p>Throughout the WEB222, I learned a lot of things and got a lot of experience.
                  For 14 weeks of studying, we did five assignments, nine tests, and almost everyone got a high score.
                   The subject and material are exciting and easy to follow, and you need to understand what is going on.
                    As for me, I learned more HTML language than javascript language, and they are both fascinating and done in a minute.
                     All of our group were very nervous in the first few days, but later, everybody understood what to do.
                      We practiced the "console.log" function for the first time with others.
                       Also, I learned to use CSS properly because it was difficult for me for the first time, but after practice, I began to do it well, like which size I needed to write or which background colour with the appropriate number.
                        However, the most significant experience I got was with writing the website. 
                        I liked this course for this opportunity for teaching me how to do it and make progress in Computer Programming.</p>
